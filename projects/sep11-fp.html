            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project (FP) is a course-long project where we Apply the content we are learning in daily lessons to our own creation, Learn new content on our own, Reflect upon our learning in a blog, and Present our product and process.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>

            <p>I was nervous during a presentation, fumbling and struggling to make eye contact with peers. I could not find Mr. Muller because I was looking at him for most of the time, this lead to me stuttering and my body temperature increasing. I hoped that everyone would forget about the presentation and looked at their scattered friends for eye contact credit. After overcoming their nervousness, I finished their presentation and went back to my seat. I think the only reason I didn't win was that I didn't show up at the correct time for the expo. The day of the Expo, I had just come back from a trip to Niagara Falls. It was an amazing experience to see that massive body of water cascading into another. We left at 1 am on Monday, and it took us six hours to get home. I just took a shower, changed, and went to school.

                After the first period started, I noticed two classmates who were also in SEP didn't show up, even though I'd seen them before class, so I forgot about it. In the middle of class, I decided to check if something was going on and realized we had the expo. I told my first-period teacher I had to go and headed to the cafeteria. When I arrived, I saw everyone with their computers and knew I'd missed my chance to present my product.

                I talked to Mr. Mueller, who gave me a stern talk about being late and missing my opportunity. I apologized and prayed the judges would finish early and still see my product. I gave them my elevator pitch: "Have you ever watched an airplane take off and wondered what goes into making that moment just right? What if there was a tool that could guarantee the perfect takeoff every time, enhancing safety for everyone on board? That's exactly what we've created." The judges liked it, but I knew they were disappointed that I was late.</p>

            <h2>challenges</h2>
            <p>I had one main challenge and that was adding and if stamet if any of the numbers you entered was was out of boundries. I was not able to make the code work for some reason. so I looked back at my notes and was wondering why it was not working. I looked and looked and for some odd reason the code did not want to work. So What I did was going to my learning log and looking at what else I can add to make this work. I found it and lo and behold It worked and was finshed with my project.</p>
            <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
            <p>The skills I learned were growth mindset and creativity. I developed a growth mindset by being patient,This wasn't always easy.By doing so, I overcame challenges and improved my project. As for creativity, my innovation was very imaginative and original, as the judges noted. </p>
