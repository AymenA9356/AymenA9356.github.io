            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project (FP) is a course-long project where we Apply the content we are learning in daily lessons to our own creation, Learn new content on our own, Reflect upon our learning in a blog, and Present our product and process.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>With just three days remaining until the expo, I struggled to come up with a one-minute hook for my presentation. Despite my efforts to condense it, my pitch was still over one minute long. The day before the expo, I panicked and attempted to remove some content. Eventually, I settled on an elevator pitch that highlighted my interest in aviation, my website showcasing past and current innovations, and my own innovative solution to enhance security in aviation. On the day of the expo, I was incredibly nervous and stressed about potentially messing up. When my turn came, I delivered my pitch, and the judges seemed either very interested or confused, as they asked numerous questions afterward. Seeking validation, I asked my friend how I did, and he reassured me that I did well. Despite having presented, I remained anxious as I awaited the results and wondered if I would be chosen to present at the showcase. Presenting in front of my classmates, who I knew personally, heightened my nervousness. However, I believed I did a good job with my slides. Before the class ended, Mr. Mueller announced the winner of the expo, and to my surprise, it was me. This meant I would have to present in front of a larger audience consisting of all SEP classes, family members, and Deloitte members, totaling around 170-180 people. The following day, I received feedback, which surprised me because I thought I had performed well. It turned out that I lacked a proper hook and failed to maintain good eye contact with the entire class. Additionally, I did not show my website effectively, although I did provide a yellkey link for anyone that was interested. The code snippets I presented were difficult to see as well. However, I did learn valuable skills throughout this experience, such as having a growth mindset and fostering creativity. I demonstrated patience and bravery by seeking help when faced with challenges. The judges recognized my innovation as being highly creative. Overall, despite the obstacles and areas for improvement in my presentation, winning the expo was a significant achievement. I can use the feedback received to enhance my presentation skills and continue developing my innovation. My innovation has a lot of positives. For example, on a global scale, it will have big systems all around the world because it will be in almost every airport. On a social scale, it will change individuals and the culture of Aviation security by almost eliminating all lines in security. On the economic side, it will increase the number of jobs and will also change the infrastructure.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>All I had to do was to make my Invention and my tool and put it into my code and I was finished, So I did all that, making my invention and my tool. Once I wanted to put it to my code something horrifying happened. My invention was covering my website and I could not see anything except my tool. I was happy but my website was gone. I had to figure this out quickly before Monday because That was when I had my MVP due. I then went over to youtube and found nothing and asked people on Slack and they did not have an answer. I then tried to put it in a separate (div) class and that did not work. I then used an (ID) and that also did not work so I asked mr: Mueller but it was a Saturday night so I thought that he might be busy. So I just committed and pushed and went to sleep. The next day I woke up only thinking about fixing my website. I asked my friends but they were using a different tool than me so I then panicked. I kept trying to find an answer until I was so desperate to fix the website that I used chatgpt. I told the AI my problem and it gave me a code. I plugged it in and it did not work. So I said that the code it gave me did not work so it gave me another code and that worked so I was able to see my website. I was so happy because I was working on my website for 4.5 hours. And to my horror, my website froze. I could not go up and down on my website. The only thing that was functioning was my tool but I was not able to scroll up and down on my website so I thought that I was on my computer too much and I was going to ask Mr: Mueller on Monday. Monday came and Mr: Muller gave me the correct code for me to fix my website</p>
            <h2>Self-Reflection</h2>
             <p>The Skills I learned were growth mindset and creativity. I learned those skills because I was patent and brave to ask for help. As for creativity, my innovation was very creative as the judges have said.</p>
